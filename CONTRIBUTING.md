# Contributing to Checkbox

## Introduction

This document provides the information needed to contribute to Checkbox
and its providers.

## General recommendations

Setup your editor of choice to run
[autopep8](https://pypi.org/project/autopep8/) on save. This helps keep
everything passing [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/). The
code doesn’t have to be pylint-clean, but running
[pylint](https://www.pylint.org/) on your code may inform you about
issues that could come up later in the review process.

## Testing

### Hacking on Checkbox and/or its providers

If you want to hack on Checkbox or its providers, one method is to
install everything you need in a Python virtual environment:

``` bash
# Install the required tools
$ sudo apt install git python3-virtualenv

# Prepare the development environment
$ mkdir ~/checkbox-dev/
$ cd ~/checkbox-dev/
$ git clone git+ssh://pieq@git.launchpad.net/checkbox-ng
$ git clone git+ssh://pieq@git.launchpad.net/checkbox-support
$ git clone git+ssh://pieq@git.launchpad.net/plainbox-provider-resource
$ git clone git+ssh://pieq@git.launchpad.net/plainbox-provider-checkbox

# Create and activate the Python virtual environment
$ cd ~/checkbox-dev/checkbox-ng
$ ./mk-venv
$ . ~/checkbox-dev/checkbox-ng/venv/bin/activate

# Activate the base providers in the virtual environment
(venv) $ cd ~/checkbox-dev/plainbox-provider-resource/
(venv) $ ./manage.py develop -d $PROVIDERPATH
(venv) $ cd ~/checkbox-dev/plainbox-provider-checkbox
(venv) $ ./manage.py develop -d $PROVIDERPATH

# Install the Checkbox support library in the virtual environment
(venv) $ cd ~/checkbox-dev/checkbox-support
(venv) $ ./setup.py install

# You should now be able to run checkbox, select a test plan and run it
(venv) $ checkbox-cli
```

### Writing and running unit tests for Checkbox

Writing unit tests for your code is strongly recommended. For functions
with an easily defined input and output, use
[doctest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html). For more
complex units of code use the standard [unittest
library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html).

### Writing and running unit tests for providers

Ensure the job and test plan definitions follow the correct syntax using
the validate command:

    $ ./manage.py validate

Run checks for code quality of provider hosted scripts and any unit
tests for providers:

    $ ./manage.py test

## Version control recommendations

### Commit title

In general, try to follow [Chris Beams’
recommendations](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/). In a
nutshell:

> -   Limit the length of the title to 50 characters
> -   Begin title with a capital letter
> -   Use the imperative mode (your title should always be able to
>     complete the sentence “If applied, this commit will...”)

In addition, if it makes sense to do so, prefix the title with one of
the following terms:

> -   Add
> -   Change
> -   Remove
> -   Fix

Example:

    Add: New screen to re-run failed jobs

### Commit message body

Quoting again from Chris Beams’ article, use the body to explain what
and why vs. how.

Example:

    Change: Shellcheck on bin dir scripts

    The test command to manage.py currently looks for python unittests
    in the provider tests/ directory. This change searches the bin/
    directory for files with suffix .sh and automatically generates
    a unittest that runs the shellcheck command on the file.

### Linking a commit to a Launchpad bug

If your commit fixes a Launchpad bug, you can link to it by adding the
following line in the commit message body (where “123456” is the
Launchpad bug number):

    LP: #123456

See [this article on the Launchpad
blog](https://blog.launchpad.net/code/linking-git-merge-proposals-to-bugs)
for more information.

### Splitting work in separate commits if required

If the changes you provide affect different parts of the project, it is
better to split them in different commits. This helps others when
reviewing the changes, helps investigation later on if a problem is
found and usually helps the original developer to better explain and
organize his/her changes.

For example, if you add a new screen to the Checkbox text user interface
(TUI) and then modify Checkbox internals to work with this new screen,
it is good to have one commit for the new screen, and one for the
internals changes.

Each commit should be stable, i.e. not introduce regressions or make
tests fail. If two or more commits have to be used together, then they
should become one commit.

### Rework your changes

Sometimes it is necessary to modify your changes (for instance after
they have been reviewed by others). Instead of creating new commits with
these new modifications, it is preferred to use Git features such as
[rebase](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History) to
rework your existing commits.

## Merge requests

### General workflow

Follow these steps to make a change to a Checkbox-related project. We
will use the [Checkbox
provider](https://launchpad.net/plainbox-provider-checkbox) for this
example, but the same applies for other projects.

1.  Using the instructions provided in the Code section, get the Git
    repository on your device:

        git clone git+ssh://your-launchpad-id@git.launchpad.net/plainbox-provider-checkbox

2.  Add a remote pointing to your own Launchpad account. This will be
    helpful when pushing the changes and asking for it to be reviewed
    and merged. Here, I create a remote called “perso” that points to my
    fork of the repository on Launchpad (replace “pieq” with your own
    Launchpad username):

        $ git remote add perso git+ssh://pieq@git.launchpad.net/~pieq/plainbox-provider-checkbox
        $ git remote -v
        origin    git+ssh://pieq@git.launchpad.net/plainbox-provider-checkbox (fetch)
        origin    git+ssh://pieq@git.launchpad.net/plainbox-provider-checkbox (push)
        perso    git+ssh://pieq@git.launchpad.net/~pieq/plainbox-provider-checkbox (fetch)
        perso    git+ssh://pieq@git.launchpad.net/~pieq/plainbox-provider-checkbox (push)

3.  Create a branch and switch to it to start working on your changes.
    You can use any branch name, but it is generally good to include the
    Launchpad bug number it relates to as well as a quick explanation of
    what the branch is about:

        $ git checkout -b 123456-invalid-session-content

4.  Work on your changes, test them, iterate, commit your work.

5.  Before sending your changes for review, make sure to rebase your
    work using the most up-to-date data from the main repository:

        $ git checkout master
        $ git pull
        $ git checkout 123456-invalid-session-content
        $ git rebase master
        First, rewinding head to replay your work on top of it...
        Applying: <your commits>

6.  Push your changes to your Launchpad repository:

        $ git push perso
        Enumerating objects: 741, done.
        Counting objects: 100% (612/612), done.
        Delta compression using up to 4 threads
        Compressing objects: 100% (242/242), done.
        Writing objects: 100% (522/522), 80.41 KiB | 26.80 MiB/s, done.
        Total 522 (delta 336), reused 460 (delta 280)
        remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (336/336), completed with 54 local objects.
        remote:           
        remote: Create a merge proposal for '123456-invalid-session-content' on Launchpad by visiting:
        remote:           https://code.launchpad.net/~pieq/plainbox-provider-checkbox/+git/plainbox-provider-checkbox/+ref/123456-invalid-session-content/+register-merge
        remote:           
        To git+ssh://git.launchpad.net/~pieq/plainbox-provider-checkbox
         * [new branch]          123456-invalid-session-content -> 123456-invalid-session-content

7.  Follow the link provided by Launchpad in the previous step to create a merge request. The most important options of the “Propose for merging” page are:  
    1.  `Repository` and `Branch`: Where your changes should land once
        they are approved. It should be already filled with the
        appropriate information.
    2.  `Description of the change`: Explain why this change is
        required, how it was tested (and on what hardware) and how other
        people can test it.
    3.  Other fields do not have to be changed. Press the
        `Propose Merge` button and wait for feedback ;-)

### What to do if reviewers suggest changes in your merge request?

1.  Change the top status of the MR to “Work in progress”. This both
    stops people wasting time reviewing some code which will be changed
    and also allows Launchpad to indicate to people who have already
    reviewed that the code should be reviewed again.
2.  Instead of adding extra commits to fix your previous commits, use
    [git rebase
    features](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History)
    to modify your existing commits. You can push your changes again to
    your personal repository; you will probably need to use the
    `git push --force my_repo` command since you “modified history”, but
    this is fine since you are pushing changes that have not been merged
    into the main repository yet.
3.  When you have pushed the new version addressing the previous round
    of reviews, switch the top status back to “Needs review”. Launchpad
    will send out an e-mail indicating that reviews are needed again. Do
    not post a comment with type “Resubmit”; this is not the purpose of
    that sort of comment.

### Finally...

Once enough people have reviewed and approved your work, it can be
merged into the main repository. Ask a member of the Checkbox team to
switch the merge request status from “Needs review” to “Approved”. The
branch should be then shortly automatically merged. Its status will then
change from “Approved” to “Merged”.
