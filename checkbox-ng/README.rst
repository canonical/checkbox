PlainBox
========

PlainBox is a toolkit consisting of python3 library, development tools,
documentation and examples. It is targeted at developers working on testing or
certification applications and authors creating tests for such applications.

PlainBox can be used to both create simple and comprehensive test tools as well
as to develop and execute test jobs and test scenarios. It was created as a
refined and rewritten core of the CheckBox project. It has a well tested and
documented core, small but active development community and a collection of
associated projects that use it as a lower-level engine/back-end library.

PlainBox has a novel approach to discovering (and probing) hardware and
software that is extensible and not hardwired into the system. It allows test
developers to express association between a particular test and the hardware,
software and configuration constraints that must be met for the test to execute
meaningfully. This feature, along with pluggable test definitions, makes
PlainBox flexible and applicable to many diverse testing situations, ranging
from mobile phones, traditional desktop computers, servers and up to testing
"cloud" installations.
