        Skeleton for a new PlainBox provider
        ====================================

        This is a skeleton PlainBox provider that was generated using
        ``plainbox startprovider ...``.

        It is just the starting point, there is nothing here of value to you
        yet. If you know how this works then just remove this file along with
        other example content and start working on your new tests,
        otherwise, read on.

        Inside the ``jobs/`` directory you will find several files that define
        a number of "jobs" (more than one job per file actually). A job, in
        PlainBox parlance, is the smallest piece of executable test code. Each
        job has a name and a number of other attributes.

        Jobs can be arranged in test plans - lists that specify which jobs to
        run. You can create as many test plans as you need, referring to
        arbitrary subsets of your jobs.

        Then there are the ``bin/`` and ``data/`` directories. Those are
        entirely for custom content you may need. You can put arbitrary
        executables in ``bin/``, and those will be available to your job
        definitions. Similarly you can keep any data your jobs might need
        inside the ``data/`` directory. Referring to that directory at runtime
        is a little bit trickier but one of the examples generated in this
        skeleton shows how to do that.

        Lastly there is the ``manage.py`` script. It requires python3 to run.
        It depends on the python3-plainbox Debian package (or just the
        PlainBox 0.5 upstream package) installed. This script can automate and
        simplify a number of tasks that you will want to do as a test
        developer.

        Run ``./manage.py --help`` to see what sub-commands are available. You
        can additionally pass ``--help`` to each sub command, for example
        ``./manage.py install --help`` will print the description of the
        install command and all the arguments it supports.

        That is it for now. You should check out the official documentation
        for test authors at
        http://plainbox.readthedocs.org/en/latest/author/index.html

        If you find bugs or would like to see additional features developed
        you can file bugs on the parent project page:

            _description:
               This test illustrates how a job can be a dependency of another
               job. The dependency graph can be arbitrarily complex, it just
               cannot have any cycles. PlainBox will discover various problems
               related to dependencies, including cyclic dependencies and
               jobs that are depended upon, without a definition.
               .
               This job simply "passes" all the time but realistic examples
               may include multi-stage manipulation (detect a device, set it
               up, perform some automatic and some manual tests and summarise
               the results, for example)

               .
               If you run this example unmodified (selecting just this job)
               you will see that PlainBox will automatically run the
               'dependency-target' job before attempting to run this one.
               This will happen, even if you explicitly order the jobs
               incorrectly.
               .
               If you edit the 'dependency-target' job to run 'false' instead
               of 'true' and rerun this job you will see that it automatically
               fails without being started. This is because of a rule which
               automatically fails any job that has a failed dependency.

               .
               Technically a resource is a list of records with named fields.
               Any program that prints RFC822-like output can be considered a
               valid resource. Here a hypothetical resource program has

               with the field ``device``.
               .
               Resources are ran on demand, their output parsed and stored.
               All resources are made available to jobs that use resource
               programs. See the next job for an example of how that can be

            _purpose:
               This test illustrates two concepts. It is the first test that
               uses manual jobs (totally not automated test type). It also
               uses a resource dependency, via a resource program, to limit
               this test only on a machine that has a hypothetical webcam.
            _steps:
               If you run this example unmodified (selecting just this job)
               you will see that PlainBox will automatically run the
               'detected_device' job before attempting to run this one. This
               will happen, even if you explicitly order the jobs incorrectly.
            _verification:
               If you edit the resource job to not print information about the
               hypothetical WEBCAM device (just remove that line) and rerun
               this job you will see that it automatically gets skipped
               without being started. This is because of a rule which
               automatically skips any job that has unmet requirement.
