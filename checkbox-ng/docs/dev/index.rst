Core Developers
===============

This chapter organizes information useful for developers working on the core,
aka, PlainBox inself.

.. note::

    The PlainBox project hopes to be a friendly developer environment. We
    invested in a lot of tools to make your life easier. Despite being a
    business-centric software project we welcome and encourage contributions
    from both Canonical and Community members.
