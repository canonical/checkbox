:mod:`plainbox.impl._argparse` -- support code for argparse compatibility
=========================================================================

This module contains a copy of argparse source code from python3.3.1.  It is
required for compatibility as argparse keeps having subtle changes in behavior
across releases.

    Vanilla copy of argparse.HelpFormatter from python 3.3.1

    This class retains the behavior of argparse as seen on that version of
    python.  This is done for compatibility and for perfectly identical output
    of PlainBox on various versions of python 3.x.

    Investigation after a rather odd test failure lead to this diff::

    The relevant part is the second change, involving the addition of ``and line``.
    It causes a line not to be printed, where it otherwise would. Since this is
    a minor visual change we chose to retain the current behavior.

    In the future, especially when python3.4 is the base version and older
    versions are not supported, a reverse patch might be applied and held here,
    to provide the non-legacy behavior.
