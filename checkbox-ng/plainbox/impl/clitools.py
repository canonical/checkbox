    either manually by calling add_parser() on the passed subparsers instance,

    Base class for implementing programs with hierarchical subcommands

    The tools support a variety of sub-commands, logging and debugging support.
    If argcomplete module is available and used properly in the shell then
    advanced tab-completion is also available.

    There are three methods to implement for a basic tool. Those are:

    1. :meth:`get_exec_name()` -- to know how the tool will be called
    2. :meth:`get_exec_version()` -- to know how the version of the tool
    3. :meth:`add_subcommands()` -- to add some actual commands to execute

    This class has some complex control flow to support important and
    interesting use cases. It is important to know that input is parsed with
    two parsers, the early parser and the full parser.  The early parser
    quickly checks for a fraction of supported arguments and uses that data to
    initialize environment before construction of a full parser is possible.
    The full parser sees the reminder of the input and does not re-parse things
    that were already handled.

    Mix-in class for ToolBase that improves responsiveness by loading
    subcommands lazily on demand and using some heuristic that works well in
    the common case of running one command.

    Unlike the original, this implementation uses a custom version of
    add_subcommands() which uses the ``early_ns`` argument as a hint to not
    load or register commands that are not going to be needed.

    In practice ``tool --help`` doesn't benefit much but ``tool <cmd>`` can now
    be much, much faster (and more responsive) as it only loads that one
    command.

    Concrete subclasses must implement the :meth:`get_command_collection()`
    method which must return a IPlugInCollection (ideally the
    LazyPlugInCollection that contains extra optimizations for low-cost key
    enumeration and one-at-a-time value loading).
