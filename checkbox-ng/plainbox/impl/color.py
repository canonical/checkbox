    Canonical Color Palette.

    Colour is an effective, powerful and instantly recognisable medium for
    visual communications. To convey the brand personality and brand values,
    there is a sophisticated colour palette.

    We have introduced a palette which includes both a fresh, lively orange,
    and a rich, mature aubergine. The use of aubergine indicates commercial
    involvement, while orange is a signal of community engagement.

    These colours are used widely in the brand communications, to convey the
    precise, reliable and free personality.

    Ubuntu core colours.

    The Ubuntu colour palette has been created to reflect the spirit of our
    brand. :attr:`ubuntu_orange` for a community feel. :attr:`white` for a
    clean, fresh and light feel.

    :attr:`black` is used in some versions of the brandmark for flexibility of
    application and where print restrictions apply. It can also be used for
    body copy.

    Supporting colours

    In addition, there is a supporting colour palette for when communications
    have a consumer or enterprise focus.

     - :attr:`light_aubergine` for a consumer focus
     - :attr:`dark_aubergine` for an enterprise focus
     - :attr:`mid_aubergine` for a balance of both

    Neutral colours.

    :attr:`warm_grey`

        For balance. The addition of warm grey softens the combination of
        orange and aubergine and provides a bridge between the two.

        Warm grey can be used for; backgrounds, graphics, pictograms, dot
        patterns, charts and diagrams. It can also be used for large size text.

    :attr:`cool_grey`
        For typography, particularly body copy. Black can be quite harsh in
        combination with aubergine, but grey delivers more balance while still
        being legible.

        Cool grey can also be used within charts and diagrams.

    :attr:`text_grey`
        Text grey is used for small size headings, sub-headings and body
        copy text only.

    Canonical core colours.

    The Canonical colour palette has been created to reflect the spirit of our
    brand. Aubergine for a smart, focussed feel. White for a clean, fresh and
    light feel.
