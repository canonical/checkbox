    """
    Base class for implementing commands like 'plainbox'.

    The tools support a variety of sub-commands, logging and debugging
    support. If argcomplete module is available and used properly in
    the shell then advanced tab-completion is also available.

    There are four methods to implement for a basic tool. Those are:

    1. :meth:`get_exec_name()` -- to know how the command will be called
    2. :meth:`get_exec_version()` -- to know how the version of the tool
    3. :meth:`add_subcommands()` -- to add some actual commands to execute
    4. :meth:`get_config_cls()` -- to know which config to use

    This class has some complex control flow to support important and
    interesting use cases. There are some concerns to people that subclass this
    in order to implement their own command line tools.

    The first concern is that input is parsed with two parsers, the early
    parser and the full parser. The early parser quickly checks for a fraction
    of supported arguments and uses that data to initialize environment before
    construction of a full parser is possible. The full parser sees the
    reminder of the input and does not re-parse things that were already
    handled.

    The second concern is that this command natively supports the concept of a
    config object and a provider object. This may not be desired by all users
    but it is the current state as of this writing. This means that by the time
    eary init is done we have a known provider and config objects that can be
    used to instantiate command objects in :meth:`add_subcommands()`. This API
    might change when full multi-provider is available but details are not
    known yet.
