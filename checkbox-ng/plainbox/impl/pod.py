Plain Old Data.

:mod:`plainbox.impl.pod`
========================

This module contains the :class:`POD` and :class:`Field` classes that simplify
creation of declarative struct-like data holding classes. POD classes get a
useful repr() method, useful initializer and accessors for each of the fields
defined inside. POD classes can be inherited (properly detecting any field
clashes)

Defining POD classes:

    >>> class Person(POD):
    ...     name = Field("name of the person", str, MANDATORY)
    ...     age = Field("age of the person", int)


Creating POD instances, positional arguments match field definition order:

    >>> joe = Person("joe", age=42)

Full-blown comparison (not only equality):

    >>> joe == Person("joe", 42)
    True

Reading and writing attributes also works (obviously):

    >>> joe.name
    'joe'
    >>> joe.age
    42
    >>> joe.age = 24
    >>> joe.age
    24

For a full description check out the documentation of the :class:`POD` and
:class:`Field`.

class Field:
    """
    A field in a plain-old-data class.

    Each field declares one attribute that can be read and written to. Just
    like a C structure. Attributes are readable _and_ writable but there is a
    lot of flexibility in what happens.

    :attr name:
        Name of the field (this is how this field can be accessed on the class
        or instance that contains it). This gets set by
        :meth:`_FieldCollection.inspect_namespace()`
    :attr instance_attr:
        Name of the POD dictionary entry used as backing store. This is set the
        same as ``name`` above. By default that's just name prepended with the
        ``'_'`` character.
    :attr type:
        An optional type hit. This is not used by default but assign filters
        can inspect and use this for type checking. It can also be used for
        documenting the intent of the field.
    :attr __doc__:
        The docstring of the field, as initialized by the caller.
    :attr initial:
        Initial value of this field, can be changed by passing arguments to
        :meth:`POD.__init__()`. May be set to ``MANDATORY`` for a special
        meaning (see below).
    :attr initial_fn:
        If not None this is a callable that produces the ``initial`` value for
        each new POD object.
    :attr notify:
        If True, a on_{name}_changed
        A flag controlling if notification events are sent for each
        modification of POD data through field.
    :attr notify_fn:
        An (optional) function to use as the first responder to the change
        notification signal. This field is only used if the ``notify``
        attribute is set to ``True``.
    :attr assign_filter_list:
        An (optional) list of assignment filter functions.

    A field is initialized based on the arguments passed to the POD
    initializer. If no argument is passed that would correspond to a given
    field the *initial* value is used. The *initial* value is either a constant
    (reference) stored in the ``initial`` property of the field or the return
    value of the callable in ``initial_fn``. Please make sure to use
    ``initial_fn`` if the value is not immutable as otherwise the produced
    value may be unintentionally shared by multiple objects.

    If the ``initial`` value is the special constant ``MANDATORY`` then the
    corresponding field must be explicitly initialized by the POD initializer
    argument list or a TypeError is raised.

    The ``notify`` flag controls the existence of the ``on_{name}_changed(old,
    new)`` signal on the class that includes the field. Applications can
    connect to that signal to observe changes. The signal is fired whenever the
    newly-assigned value compares *unequal* to the value currently stored in
    the POD.

    The ``notify_fn`` is an optional function that is used instead of the
    default (internal) :meth:`on_changed()` method of the Field class itself.
    If specified it must have the same three-argument signature. It will be
    called whenever the value of the field changes. Note that it will also be
    called on the initial assignment, when the ``old`` argument it receives
    will be set to the special ``UNSET`` object.

    Lastly a docstring and type hint can be provided for documentation. The
    type check is not enforced.

    Assignment filters are used to inspect and optionally modify a value during
    assignment (including the assignment done on object initialization) and can
    be used for various operations (including type conversions and validation).
    Assignment filters are called whenever a field is used to write to a POD.

    Since assignment filters are arranged in a list and executed in-order, they
    can also be used to modify the value as it gets propagated through the list
    of filters.

    The signature of each filter is ``fn(pod, field, old_value, new_value)``.
    The return value is the value shown to the subsequent filter or finally
    assigned to the POD.
