APIs for working with providers.

:mod:`plainbox.impl.providers` -- providers package
===================================================

Providers are a mechanism by which PlainBox can enumerate jobs and test plans.
Currently there are only v1 (as in version one) providers that basically have
to behave as CheckBox itself (mini CheckBox forks for example)

V1 providers
------------

The first (current) version of PlainBox providers has the following properties,
this is also described by :class:`IProvider1`::

    * there is a directory with '.txt' or '.txt.in' files with RFC822-encoded
      job definitions. The definitions need a particular set of keys to work.

    * there is a directory with additional executables (added to PATH)

    * there is a directory with an additional python3 libraries (added to
      PYTHONPATH)

        A list of Provider1 objects, created in no particular order.

    This function can be used to get a list of all available providers. Most
    applications will just want the default, regular list of providers, without
    bothering to restrict themselves to the secure subset.

    Those are the providers that can run jobs as root using the
    ``plainbox-trusted-launcher-1`` mechanism. Depending on the *policykit*
    Policy, those might start without prompting the user for the password. If
    you want to load only them, use the `only_secure` option.
