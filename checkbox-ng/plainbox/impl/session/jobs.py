Job State.

:mod:`plainbox.impl.session.jobs` -- jobs state handling
========================================================

This module contains a helper class for associating job state within a
particular session. The :class:`JobState` class holds references to a
:class:`JobDefinition` and :class:`JobResult` as well as a list of inhibitors
that prevent the job from being runnable in a particular session.

    Class representing the cause of a job not being ready to execute.

    It is intended to be consumed by UI layers and to provide them with enough
    information to render informative error messages or other visual feedback
    that will aid the user in understanding why a job cannot be started.

    There are four possible not ready causes:

        UNDESIRED:
            This job was not selected to run in this session

        PENDING_DEP:
           This job depends on another job which was not started yet

            produced by another job which was not started yet

        FAILED_RESOURCE:
            This job has a resource requirement that evaluated to a false value

        NOT_FAILED_DEP:
            This job depends on another job failing, but it did not fail

    All causes apart from UNDESIRED use the related_job property to encode a
    job that is related to the problem. The PENDING_RESOURCE and
    FAILED_RESOURCE causes also store related_expression that describes the
    relevant requirement expression.

    There are three attributes that can be accessed:

        cause:
            Encodes the reason why a job is not ready, see
            :class:`InhibitionCause`.

        related_job:
            Provides additional context for the problem. This is not the job
            that is affected, rather, the job that is causing the problem.

        related_expression:
            Provides additional context for the problem caused by a failing
            resource expression.
