Session resume handling.

:mod:`plainbox.impl.session.resume` -- session resume handling
==============================================================

This module contains classes that can resume a dormant session from
a binary representation. See docs for the suspend module for details.

The resume logic provides a compromise between usefulness and correctness
so two assumptions are made:

* We assume that a checksum of a job changes when their behavior changes.
  This way we can detect when job definitions were updated after
  suspending but before resuming.

* We assume that software and hardware *may* change while the session is
  suspended but this is not something that framework (PlainBox) is
  concerned with. Applications should provide job definitions that
  are capable of detecting this and acting appropriately.

  This is true since the user may install additional packages
  or upgrade existing packages. The user can also add or remove pluggable
  hardware. Lastly actual machine suspend (or hibernate) and resume *may*
  cause alterations to the hardware as it is visible from within
  the system. In any case the framework does not care about this.

        ``FLAG_REWRITE_LOG_PATHNAMES_S``:
            Flag controlling rewriting of log file pathnames. It depends on the
            location to be non-None and then rewrites pathnames of all them
            missing log files to be relative to the session storage location.
            It effectively depends on FLAG_FILE_REFERENCE_CHECKS_F being set at
            the same time, otherwise it is ignored.

        ``FLAG_IGNORE_JOB_CHECKSUMS_S``:
            Flag controlling integrity checks between jobs present at resume
            time and jobs present at suspend time. Since providers cannot be
            serialized (nor should they) this integrity check prevents anyone
            from resuming a session if job definitions have changed. Using this
