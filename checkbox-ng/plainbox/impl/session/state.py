class SessionState:

    """
    Class representing all state needed during a single program session.

    This is the central glue/entry-point for applications. It connects user
    intents to the rest of the system / plumbing and keeps all of the state in
    one place.

    The set of utility methods and properties allow applications to easily
    handle the lower levels of dependencies, resources and ready states.

    :class:`SessionState` has the following instance variables, all of which
    are currently exposed as properties.

    :ivar list job_list: A list of all known jobs

        Not all the jobs from this list are going to be executed (or selected
        for execution) by the user.

        This list cannot have any duplicates, if that is the case a
        :class:`DependencyDuplicateError` is raised. This has to be handled
        externally and is a sign that the job database is corrupted or has
        wrong data. As an exception if duplicates are perfectly identical this
        error is silently corrected.

    :ivar list unit_list: A list of all known units

        This list contains all the known units, including all the know job
        definitions (and in the future, all test plans).

        It may change at runtime because of template instantiations.

    :ivar dict job_state_map: mapping that tracks the state of each job

        Mapping from job id to :class:`JobState`. This basically has the test
        result and the inhibitor of each job. It also serves as a
        :attr:`plainbox.impl.job.JobDefinition.id`-> job lookup helper.

        Directly exposed with the intent to fuel part of the UI. This is a way
        to get at the readiness state, result and readiness inhibitors, if any.

        XXX: this can loose data job_list has jobs with the same id. It would
        be better to use job id as the keys here. A separate map could be used
        for the id->job lookup. This will be fixed when session controller
        branch lands in trunk as then jobs are dynamically added to the system
        one at a time and proper error conditions can be detected and reported.

    :ivar list desired_job_list: subset of jobs selected for execution

        This is used to compute :attr:`run_list`. It can only be changed by
        calling :meth:`update_desired_job_list()` which returns meaningful
        values so this is not a settable property.

    :ivar list run_list: sorted list of jobs to execute

        This is basically a superset of desired_job_list and a subset of
        job_list that is topologically sorted to allowing all desired jobs to
        run. This property is updated whenever desired_job_list is changed.

    :ivar dict resource_map: all known resources

        A mapping from resource id to a list of
        :class:`plainbox.impl.resource.Resource` objects. This encapsulates all
        "knowledge" about the system plainbox is running on.


        It is needed to compute job readiness (as it stores resource data
        needed by resource programs). It is also available to exporters.

        This is computed internally from the output of checkbox resource jobs,
        it can only be changed by calling :meth:`update_job_result()`
