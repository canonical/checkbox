:mod:`plainbox.impl.symbol` -- Symbol Type
==========================================

Symbols are special values that evaluate back to themselves. They are global,
unlike enumeration values, and are not bound to any container that defined
them. Symbols can be easily converted to strings and back and are a useful way
to store constants for use inside applications or libraries.

Applications can use Symbol class directly or use the SymbolDef helper to
quickly construct symbols without syntax overhead.
