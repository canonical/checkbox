:mod:`plainbox.vendor` -- vendorized packages
=============================================

This module contains external packages that were vendorized (shipped with a
tree of another project) to simplify dependency management. These may
be modules that have to be modified to be compatible with an old python
version or tools that we need but don't want to package for every
redistribution avenue that we currently use.
