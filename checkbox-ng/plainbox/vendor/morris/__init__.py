:mod:`plainbox.vendor.morris` --  announcement (signal/event) system for Python
===============================================================

The plainbox.vendor.morris module defines two main classes :class:`signal` and
:class:`SignalTestCase`.

Defining Signals
----------------

.. note::
    Since version 1.1 ``Signal.define`` and ``signal`` are identical

You can import the ``signal`` class and use idiomatic code like::

    >>> from plainbox.vendor.morris import signal

    >>> # NOTE: classic python 2.x classes are not supported
    >>> class Klass(object):
    ...     @signal
    ...     def on_foo(self):
    ...         pass

    >>> @signal
    ... def on_bar():
    ...     pass

Connecting signal listeners
---------------------------

Connecting signals is equally easy, just call :meth:`signal.connect()`

    >>> def handler():
    ...     print("handling signal")

    >>> obj = Klass()
    >>> obj.on_foo.connect(handler)
    >>> on_bar.connect(handler)

Firing signals
--------------

To fire a signal simply *call* the signal object::

    >>> obj.on_foo()
    handling signal
    >>> on_bar()
    handling signal

Typically you will want to pass some additional arguments. Both positional
and keyword arguments are supported::

    >>> @signal
    ... def on_bar_with_args(arg1, arg2):
    ...     print("fired!")

    >>> on_bar_with_args('foo', arg2='bar')
    fired!

If you are working in a tight loop it is slightly faster to construct the list
of positional arguments and the dictionary of keyword arguments and call the
:meth:`Signal.fire()` method directly::

    >>> args = ('foo',)
    >>> kwargs = {'arg2': 'bar'}
    >>> for i in range(3):
    ...     on_bar_with_args.fire(args, kwargs)
    fired!
    fired!
    fired!

Passing additional meta-data to the signal listener
---------------------------------------------------

In some cases you may wish to use a generic signal handler that would benefit
from knowing which signal has triggered it. To do that first make sure that
your handler has a ``signal`` argument and then call ``sig.connect(handler,
pass_signal=True)``:

    >>> def generic_handler(*args, **kwargs):
    ...     signal = kwargs.pop('signal')
    ...     print("Handling signal {}: {} {}".format(signal, args, kwargs))

Let's define two signals now:

    >>> @signal
    ... def login(user, password):
    ...     pass
    >>> @signal
    ... def logout(user):
    ...     pass

And connect both to the same handler:

    >>> login.connect(generic_handler, pass_signal=True)
    >>> logout.connect(generic_handler, pass_signal=True)

Now we can fire either one and see our handler work:

    >>> login(str('user'), password=str('pass'))
    Handling signal <signal name:'login'>: ('user',) {'password': 'pass'}
    >>> logout(str('user'))
    Handling signal <signal name:'logout'>: ('user',) {}

.. note::
    The example uses ``str(...)`` to have identical output on Python
    2.7 and 3.x but ``str()`` it is otherwise useless.

This also works with classes:

    >>> class App(object):
    ...     def __repr__(self):
    ...         return "app"
    ...     @signal
    ...     def login(self, user, password):
    ...         pass
    ...     @signal
    ...     def logout(self, user):
    ...         pass
    >>> app = App()
    >>> app.login.connect(generic_handler, pass_signal=True)
    >>> app.logout.connect(generic_handler, pass_signal=True)

We can now fire the signals, just as before:

    >>> app.login(str('user'), password=str('pass'))
    ... # doctest: +ELLIPSIS, +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    Handling signal <signal name:'...login' (specific to app)>:
        ('user',) {'password': 'pass'}
    >>> app.logout(str('user'))  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    Handling signal <signal name:'...logout' (specific to app)>: ('user',) {}

Disconnecting signals
---------------------

To disconnect a signal handler call :meth:`signal.disconnect()` with the same
listener object that was used in ``connect()``:

    >>> obj.on_foo.disconnect(handler)
    >>> on_bar.disconnect(handler)

Threading considerations
------------------------

Morris doesn't do anything related to threads. Threading is diverse enough that
for now it was better to just let uses handle it. There are two things that
are worth mentioning though:

1) :meth:`signal.connect()` and :meth:`signal.disconnect()` should be safe to
   call concurrently with :meth:`signal.fire()` since fire() operates on
   a *copy* of the list of listeners

2) Event handlers are called from the thread calling :meth:`signal.fire()`,
   not from the thread that was used to connect to the signal handler. If you
   need special provisions for working with signals in a specific thread
   consider calling a thread-library-specific function that calls a callable
   in a specific thread context.

Support for writing unit tests
------------------------------

Morris ships with support for writing tests for signals. You can use
:class:`SignalTestCase`'s support methods such as
:meth:`~signalTestCase.watchSignal()`,
:meth:`~SignalTestCase.assertSignalFired()`,
:meth:`~SignalTestCase.assertSignalNotFired()` and
:meth:`~SignalTestCase.assertSignalOrdering()` to simplify your tests.

Here's a simple example using all of the above:

    >>> class App(object):
    ...     @signal
    ...     def on_login(self, user):
    ...         pass
    ...     @signal
    ...     def on_logout(self, user):
    ...         pass
    ...     def login(self, user):
    ...         self.on_login(user)
    ...     def logout(self, user):
    ...         self.on_logout(user)

    >>> class AppTests(SignalTestCase):
    ...     def setUp(self):
    ...         self.app = App()
    ...         self.watchSignal(self.app.on_login)
    ...         self.watchSignal(self.app.on_logout)
    ...     def test_login(self):
    ...         # Log the user in, then out
    ...         self.app.login("user")
    ...         self.app.logout("user")
    ...         # Ensure that both login and logout signals were sent
    ...         event1 = self.assertSignalFired(self.app.on_login, 'user')
    ...         event2 = self.assertSignalFired(self.app.on_logout, 'user')
    ...         # Ensure that signals were fired in the right order
    ...         self.assertSignalOrdering(event1, event2)
    ...         # Ensure that we didn't login as admin
    ...         self.assertSignalNotFired(self.app.on_login, 'admin')

    >>> import sys
    >>> suite = unittest.TestLoader().loadTestsFromTestCase(AppTests)
    >>> runner = unittest.TextTestRunner(stream=sys.stdout, verbosity=2)
    >>> runner.run(suite)  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS

Implementation notes
--------------------

At some point in time one may need to peek under the cover and understand where
the list of signal listeners is being stored and how signals interact with
classes. First of all, the :class:`signal` class can be used as a Python
descriptor. Descriptors are objects that have methods such as ``__get__``,
``__set__`` or ``__delete__``.

You have most certainly used descriptors before, in fact the well-known
``@property`` decorator is nothing more than a class with methods such as
listed above.

When used as a descriptor, a signal object will **create new signal objects
each time it is being accessed on an instance of some class**. The instance of
some class will be injected with a ``__signals__`` dictionary that contains
signals that have been accessed.

Consider this example::

    >>> class Foo(object):
    ...     @signal
    ...     def ping(self):
    ...         pass

Here ``Foo.ping`` is one instance of :class:`signal`. When that instance
is being accessed on a class it simply returns itself.

    >>> Foo.ping  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    <signal name:'...ping'>

.. note::
    While this looks similar to decorating a function it is functioning in a
    totally different way. Signals decorating plain functions (outside of a
    class definition body) are not using their descriptor nature.

Now, let's instantiate ``Foo`` and see what's inside::

    >>> foo = Foo()
    >>> foo.__dict__
    {}

Nothing is inside, but there will be once we access ``foo.ping``. Morris will
create a new :class:`signal` object associated with both the ``foo`` instance
and the ``foo.ping`` method. It will look for ``foo.__signals__`` and not
having found any will create one from an empty dictionary. Lastly morris will
add the newly created signal object to the dictionary. This way each time we
access ``foo.ping`` (on the particular ``foo`` object) we'll get exactly the
same signal object in return.

    >>> foo.ping  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    <signal name:'...ping' (specific to <...Foo object at ...>)>
    >>> foo.__dict__  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS, +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    {'__signals__':
     {'...ping': <signal name:'...ping'
      (specific to <...Foo object at ...>)>}}

This all happens transparently the first time that code such as
``foo.ping.connect(...)`` is executed. When you connect a signal morris simply
needs a place to store the list of listeners and that is in a signal object
itself. We can now register a simple listener.

    >>> def handler():
    ...     pass
    >>> foo.ping.connect(handler)

Handlers are stored in the :meth:`signal.listeners` attribute. They are stored
as a list of :class:`listenerinfo` tuples. Note that the first responder (the
decorated function itself) is also present, here it is wrapped in the special
(specific to morris) :class:`boundmethod` class.

    >>> foo.ping.listeners  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS, +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    [listenerinfo(listener=<...boundmethod object at ...>, pass_signal=False),
     listenerinfo(listener=<function handler at ...>, pass_signal=False)]

Now, let's compare this to using signals as a function decorator:

    >>> @signal
    ... def standalone():
    ...     pass

The ``standalone()`` function is now *replaced* by the correspondingly-named
signal object:

    >>> standalone
    <signal name:'standalone'>

The original function is connected as the first responder though:

    >>> standalone.listeners  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    [listenerinfo(listener=<function ...standalone at ...>, pass_signal=False)]

Since there are no extra objects, there is no ``__dict__`` and no
``__signals__`` either.


Using @signal on class with __slots__
-------------------------------------

Since (having read the previous section) you already know that signal
descriptors access the ``__signals__`` attribute on objects of classes they
belong to, to use signals on a class that uses ``__slots__`` you need to
reserve the ``__signals__`` slot up-front.

    >>> class Slotted(object):
    ...     __slots__ = ('__signals__')
    ...     @signal
    ...     def ping(self):
    ...         pass
    >>> Slotted.ping  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    <signal name:'...ping'>
    >>> slotted = Slotted()
    >>> slotted.ping  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    <signal name:'...ping' (specific to <...Slotted object at ...>)>
    >>> slotted.__signals__  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS, +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    {'...ping': <signal name:'...ping'
     (specific to <...Slotted object at ...>)>}

Creating signals explicitly
---------------------------

In all of the examples above we've been using signal as a decorator for
existing methods or functions. This is fine for the vast majority of code but
in some cases it may be beneficial to create signal objects explicitly. This
may be of use in meta-programming, for example.

The :class:`signal` class may be instantiated in the two following ways:
 - with the signal name (and no listeners)
 - with the first responder function (which becomes the first listener)

The second mode also has a special special case where the first responder.
Let's examine than now. First, the plain signal object:

    >>> signal(str("my-signal"))
    <signal name:'my-signal'>

This is a normal signal object, we can call it to fire the signal, we can use
the :meth:`signal.connect()` method to add listeners, etc. If you want to
create standalone signals, this is the best way to do it.

Now let's examine the case where we pass a signal handler instead of the name:

    >>> def my_signal2_handler():
    ...     pass
    >>> signal(my_signal2_handler)
    <signal name:'my_signal2_handler'>

Here the name of the signal is derived from the name of the handler function.
We can customize the name, if desired, by passing the signal_name argument
(preferably as a keyword argument to differentiate it from the ``pass_signal``
argument):

    >>> signal(my_signal2_handler, signal_name='my-signal-2')
    <signal name:'my-signal-2'>

Both examples that pass a handler are identical to what happens when decorating
a regular function. There is nothing special about this mode either.

The last, and somewhat special, mode is where the handler is an instance of
:class:`boundmethod` (which is implemented inside morris). In the Python 2.x
world, python had bound methods but they were removed. We still benefit from
them, a little, hence they are back.

    >>> class C(object):
    ...     def handler(self):
    ...         pass
    >>> signal(boundmethod(C(), C.handler))  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    <signal name:'...handler' (specific to <...C object at ...>)>

.. note::
    It is possible to remove boundmethod and rely  ``func.__self__`` but this
    was not done, yet. Contributions are welcome!

To summarize this section, some simple rules:

- each signal object has a list of listeners
- signal objects act as descriptors and create per-instance signal objects
- signal object created this way are stored in per-instance ``__signals__``
