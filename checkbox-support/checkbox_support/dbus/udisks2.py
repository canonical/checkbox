checkbox_support.dbus.udisks2
=====================

Module for working with UDisks2 from python.

There are two main classes that are interesting here.

The first class is UDisksObserver, which is easy to setup and has pythonic API
to all of the stuff that happens in UDisks2. It offers simple signal handlers
for any changes that occur in UDisks2 that were advertised by DBus.

The second class is UDisksModel, that builds on the observer class to offer
persistent collection of objects managed by UDisks2.

To work with this model you will likely want to look at:
    http://udisks.freedesktop.org/docs/latest/ref-dbus.html
