  * debian/patches/fix-lp1483410-part1: Correct the method of loading unit

    themselves.  (Closes LP: #1483410)

    so that the loop can correctly remove elements without raising exceptions.

    tests are importing modules that depend on those.

checkbox-support (0.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sylvain Pineau ]
  * New upstream release. List of bugs fixed:
    https://launchpad.net/checkbox-support/+milestone/0.2

  [ Zygmunt Krynicki ]
  * Use armoured gpg keys to avoid having to keep binary files in Debian
    packaging. Also, replace that with my key since I made the 0.2 release
    upstream. 
  * Patch away checkbox_support.vendor.mock. Also add a copyright entry for
    that module. Both changes are similar to what we do in python3-plainbox.
