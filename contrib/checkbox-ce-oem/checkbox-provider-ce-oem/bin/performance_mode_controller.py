    Get the specific context manager function of controlling performance mode.
    The function helps you load a module which can not in the PYTHONPATH.
    Therefore, developers can implement the python script of controlling
    performance mode in each Checkbox Project and be used by ce-oem's script.

    Environment Variables:
    -----------
    performance_module_path
        The full path of a python module that you are interested in even it's
        not in PYTHONPATH
    PERFORMANCE_FUNCTION_NAME
        The name of ctx function to control the performance in a module.

    --------

    SystemExit:
        If the module or function cannot be loaded, the program exits.
