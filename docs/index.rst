Checkbox
========

Checkbox is a testing framework used to validate device compatibility with
Ubuntu Linux.

It runs test plans made of test cases (or jobs) and generates test reports.
Jobs can be manual or automated. Any Linux command can be turned into a job.

Checkbox was developed as part of the `Ubuntu Certified`_ program. It runs
tests that ensure all the required features of a given device are working as
expected on Ubuntu Linux. It is compatible with any version of Ubuntu (Desktop,
Server, Core).

Checkbox is useful for anyone who wants to make sure their devices are running
as expected on Ubuntu.
