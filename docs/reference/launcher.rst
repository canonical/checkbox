Checkbox launchers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Checkbox launchers are INI files that customize checkbox experience. The
customization includes:

* choosing what jobs will be run
* how to handle machine restart
* what type of UI to use
* how to handle the results

Each section in the launcher is optional, when not supplied, the default values
will be used.

This document describes Launchers version 1.

.. _launcher_config:

External configuration files
============================

Launcher can specify external file(s) to load values from.

``[config]``
    Beginning of the configuration section.

``config_filename``
    Name of the configuration file to look for. The value may be a file name or an absolute path, and may use environment variables. If no directory is specified, the default directories where the file will be searched for are ``/etc/xdg/`` and ``~/.config/``.

    Default value: ``checkbox.conf``

Examples:

.. code-block:: ini

    # Looks for ``/etc/xdg/testing.conf`` and ``~/.config/testing.conf``
    [config]
    config_filename = testing.conf

    # Use an environment variable
    [config]
    config_filename = $MYCONFIGS/testing.conf

    # Use an absolute path
    [config]
    config_filename = /home/ubuntu/next-testing.conf

For more details about value resolution order, see :doc:`../explanation/configs`.

Launcher meta-information
=========================

Launcher meta-information helps to provide consistent checkbox behavior in the
future.

``[launcher]``
    Beginning of the launcher meta-information section.

``app_id``
    This fields helps to differentiate between checkbox front-ends. This way
    sessions started with launcher with one ``app_id`` won't interfere with
    sessions started with a different launcher (provided it has ``app_id`` set to
    other value).  The app_id should be in a IQN form. Default value:
    ``com.canonical:checkbox-cli``

``app_version``
    This field is purely informational.

``launcher_version``
    Version of the launcher language syntax and semantics to use.

``api_flags``
    API flags variable determines optional feature set.
    List of API flags that this launcher requires. Items should be separated by
    spaces or commas. The default value is an empty list.

``api_version``
    API version determines the behavior of the launcher. Each checkbox feature is
    added at a specific API version. Default behaviors don't change silently;
    explicit launcher change is required. Default value: ``0.99``

``session_title``
    A title to be applied to the sessions created using this launcher. This can be
    be used to identify a stored sessions and can be used in report generation.

``session_desc``
    A string that can be applied to sessions created using this launcher. Useful
    for storing some contextual information about the session.

``stock_reports``
    Stock reports are shortcuts in creating common reports. Instead of having to
    specify exporter, transport and a report section in a launcher, you can use any
    number of the stock ones. In launchers version 1 there are 4 stock reports you
    may use:

    * ``text``: Print results as text on standard output
    * ``submission_files``: Write ``html``, ``json`` and ``tar.xz``
      files to ``$XDG_DATA_HOME`` directory (or to ``~/.local/share/`` if
      ``$XDG_DATA_HOME`` is not defined)
    * ``certification``: Send results to certification site
    * ``certification-staging``: Send results to staging version of
      certification site

    If you don't want to have any stock report automatically generated use
    ``none`` as the value.

    This field is a list; use commas or spaces to separate stock reports. The
    default value: ``text, certification, submission_files``.

    When using ``certification`` stock report, the ``secure_id`` variable may be
    overridden by the launcher.
    To do this define ``secure_id`` in a ``transport:c3`` section (this is the
    transport that's used by the ``certification`` stock reports).

Launcher section example:

.. code-block:: ini

    [launcher]
    app_id = com.foobar:system-testing
    launcher_version = 1
    stock_reports = text
    session_title = MegaCorp Thingy Alpha-1
    session_desc = Testing the alpha-1 release of MegaCorp Thingy including feature X

Launcher using all defaults with overridden secure_id:

.. code-block:: ini

    [transport:c3]
    secure_id = 001122334455667788

Launcher that disables all stock reports:

.. code-block:: ini

    [launcher]
    app_id = com.foobar:system-testing
    launcher_version = 1
    stock_reports = none

Test plan section
=================

This section provides control over which test plans are visible in the menus
and optionally forces the app to use particular one.

``[test plan]``
    Beginning of the test plan section.

``unit``
    An ID of a test plan that should be selected by default. By default nothing is
    selected.

``filter``
    Glob that test plan IDs have to match in order to be visible. Default value:
    ``*``

``forced``
    If set to ``yes``, test plan selection screen will be skipped. Requires
    ``unit`` field to be set. Default value: ``no``.


Test selection section
======================
This section provides control over test selection.

``[test selection]``
    Beginning of the test selection section

``forced``
    If set to ``yes``, test selection screen will be skipped and all test specified
    in the test plan will be selected. Default value: ``no``

``exclude``
    List of regex patterns that job ids will be matched against. The matched jobs
    will be excluded from running in both stages of the session: bootstrapping and
    normal stage. Note that if you specify a pattern that matches a resource job
    that is used to instantiate template units those units won't get generated. The
    patterns should be separated with whitespace. Examples:

Exclude all jobs containing 'bluetooth' in their id:

.. code-block:: ini

    [test selection]
    exclude = .*bluetooth.*


Exclude all jobs containing ``bluetooth`` in their id, or having ids starting
with ``com.canonical.certification::dock/wireless``:

.. code-block:: ini

    [test selection]
    exclude = .*bluetooth.* com.canonical.certification::dock/wireless.*

Note: Exclude field set in launcher can be overridden in a config, following
Checkbox values resolution order. See :doc:`configs <../explanation/configs>` for more info.

Note: To clear the exclude list use...

::

    exclude =

...in your 'last' config.

``match``
  List of regex patterns that job ids and template ids will be matched against.
  Checkbox will only run the matching jobs, their dependencies and any job
  included in the testplan bootstrap section. This is useful to re-run the
  failing subset of jobs included in a test plan.

Only run ``bluetooth`` jobs and their dependencies:

.. code-block:: ini

  [test selection]
  match = .*bluetooth.*

.. note::
   ``exclude`` takes precedence over ``match``.

.. note::
   You can use ``match`` only to select jobs already included in a test
   plan. You can not use it to include additional tests in a test plan.

.. _launcher_ui:

User Interface section
======================

This section controls which type of UI to use.

``[ui]``
    Beginning of the user interface section

``type``
    Type of UI to use:

    * ``interactive`` runs the standard Checkbox command line version that prompts
      user in non-automated tests.
    * ``silent`` skips the tests that would require human interaction. This UI
      type requires forcing test selection and test plan selection. It's not
      'silent' in the traditional command-line tool sense.
    * ``converged`` launches the QML interface. It requires ``checkbox-converged``
      to be installed on your system.
    * ``converged-silent`` launches the QML interface and skips the tests that
      would require human interaction. It requires ``checkbox-converged`` to be
      installed on your system. This UI type requires forcing test selection and
      test plan selection.

    Default value: ``interactive``.

``dont_suppress_output``
    .. warning::

        This field is deprecated, use 'output' to specify which jobs should have
        their output printed to the screen.

    Setting this field to ``yes`` disables hiding of command output for jobs of
    type ``resource`` and ``attachment``. Default value: ``no``.

``output``
    This setting lets you hide output of commands run by checkbox. It can be set to
    one of the following values:

    - ``show`` - output of all jobs will be printed
    - ``hide-resource-and-attachment`` - output of resource and attachment jobs
      will be hidden, output of other job types will be printed
    - ``hide-automated`` - output of shell jobs as well as attachment and resource
      jobs will be hidden. Only interactive job command's output will be shown
    - ``hide`` - same as ``hide-automated``. This value is deprecated, use
      ``hide-automated``

    Default value: ``show``

    .. note::

        Individual jobs can have their output hidden by specifying
        'suppress-output' in their definition.

``verbosity``
    This setting makes checkbox report more information from checkbox internals.
    Possible values are:

    - ``normal`` - report only warnings and errors.
    - ``verbose`` - report important events that take place during execution (E.g.
      adding units, starting jobs, changing the state of the session)
    - ``debug`` - print out everything

    Default value: ``normal``

    .. note::

        You can also change this behavior when invoking Checkbox by using
        ``--verbose`` and ``--debug`` options respectively.

``auto_retry``
    If set to ``yes``, all failed jobs will automatically be retried at the end of
    the testing session. In addition, the re-run screen (where user can select
    failed and skipped jobs to re-run) will not be shown. Default value: ``no``.

    .. note::

        You can use ``auto-retry=no`` inline in the test plan to exclude a job
        from auto-retrying. For more details, see :doc:`../how-to/launcher/auto-retry`.

``max_attempts``
    Defines the maximum number of times a job should be run in auto-retry mode.
    If the job passes, it won't be retried even if the maximum number of attempts
    have not been reached. Default value: ``3``.

``delay_before_retry``
    The number of seconds to wait before retrying the failed jobs at the end of
    the testing session. This can be useful when the jobs rely on external
    factors (e.g. a WiFi access point) and you want to wait before retrying the
    same job. Default value: ``1``.

Restart section
===============

This section enables fine control over how checkbox is restarted.

``[restart]``
    Beginning of the restart section

``strategy``
    Override the restart strategy that should be used. Currently supported
    strategies are ``XDG`` and ``Snappy``. By default the best strategy is
    determined at runtime.

Environment section
===================

``[environment]``
    Beginning of the environment section

    Each variable present in the ``environment`` section will be present as
    environment variable for all jobs run.

Example:

.. code-block:: ini

    [environment]
    TESTING_HOST = 192.168.0.100

.. _generating-reports:

Daemon-specific configuration
=============================

``[agent]``
    .. warning::
        This section was previously called ``[daemon]``. This term has been
        deprecated as of Checkbox 2.9 and is planned for removal.

    Beginning of the agent-specific section.

    Settings in this section only apply to sessions that are run by :term:`Checkbox
    Agent` spawned as Systemd service.

``normal_user``
    Username to use when job doesn't specify which user to run as.

    The systemd service run on the :term:`agent` is run by root so in order to
    run some jobs as an unprivileged user this variable can be used.


Manifest section
================

``[manifest]``
    Beginning of the manifest section.

    Each variable present in the ``manifest`` section will be used as a preset value
    for the system manifest, taking precedence over the disk cache.

Example:

.. code-block:: ini

    [manifest]
    com.canonical.certification::has_touchscreen = yes
    com.canonical.certification::has_usb_type_c = true
    com.canonical.certification::foo = 23


Generating reports
==================

Creation of reports is governed by three sections: ``report``, ``exporter``, and
``transport``. Each of those sections might be specified multiple times to
provide more than one report.

Exporter
--------

``[exporter:exporter_name]``
    Beginning of an exporter declaration. Note that ``exporter_name`` should be
    replaced with something meaningful, like ``html``.

``unit``
    ID of an exporter to use. To get the list of available exporters on your system
    run ``$ checkbox-cli list exporter``.

``options``
    A list of options that will be supplied to the exporter. Items should be separated by
    spaces or commas.


Example:

.. code-block:: ini

    [exporter:html]
    unit = com.canonical.plainbox::html

Transport
---------

``[transport:transport_name]``
    Beginning of a transport declaration. Note that ``transport_name`` should be
    replaced with something meaningful, like ``standard_out``.

``type``
    Type of a transport to use. Allowed values are: ``stream``, ``file``, and
    ``submission-service``.

Depending on the type of transport there might be additional fields.

+------------------------+---------------+----------------+----------------------+


Report
------

``[report:report_name]``
    Beginning of a report declaration. Note that ``report_name`` should be
    replaced with something meaningful, like ``to_screen``.

``exporter``
    Name of the exporter to use

``transport``
    Name of the transport to use

``forced``
    If set to ``yes`` will make checkbox always produce the report (skipping the
    prompt). Default value: ``no``.

Example of all three sections working to produce a report:

.. code-block:: ini

    [exporter:text]
    unit = com.canonical.plainbox::text

    [transport:out]
    type = stream
    stream = stdout

    [report:screen]
    exporter = text
    transport = out
    forced = yes


Launcher examples
=================

1) Fully automatic run of all tests from
'com.canonical.certification::smoke' test plan concluded by producing text
report to standard output.

.. code-block:: ini

    #!/usr/bin/env checkbox-cli

    [launcher]
    launcher_version = 1
    app_id = com.canonical.certification:smoke-test
    stock_reports = text

    [test plan]
    unit = com.canonical.certification::smoke
    forced = yes

    [test selection]
    forced = yes

    [ui]
    type = silent

    [transport:outfile]
    type = stream
    stream = stdout

    [exporter:text]
    unit = com.canonical.plainbox::text

    [report:screen]
    transport = outfile
    exporter = text

2) Interactive testing of FooBar project. Report should be uploaded to the
staging version of certification site and saved to /tmp/submission.tar.xz

.. code-block:: ini

    #!/usr/bin/env checkbox-cli

    [launcher]
    launcher_version = 1
    app_id = com.foobar:system-testing

    [providers]
    use = com.megacorp.foo::bar*

    [test plan]
    unit = com.megacorp.foo::bar-generic

    [ui]
    type = silent
    output = hide

    [transport:certification]
    type = certification
    secure-id = 00112233445566
    staging = yes

    [transport:local_file]
    type = file
    path = /tmp/submission.tar.xz

    [report:c3-staging]
    transport = certification
    exporter = tar

    [report:file]
    transport = local_file
    exporter = tar

3) A typical launcher to run a desktop SRU test plan automatically.
The launcher will automatically retry the failed test jobs. Besides,
this launcher includes another launcher ``launcher.conf`` as its
customized environment configuration.

The launcher

.. code-block:: ini

    #!/usr/bin/env checkbox-cli
    [launcher]
    launcher_version = 1

    [config]
    config_filename = $HOME/launcher.conf

    [test plan]
    unit = com.canonical.certification::sru
    forced = yes

    [test selection]
    forced = yes

    [ui]
    type = silent
    auto_retry = yes
    max_attempts = 3
    delay_before_retry = 15


The launcher configuration ``launcher.conf``

.. code-block:: ini

    #!/usr/bin/env checkbox-cli
    [launcher]
    launcher_version = 1
    stock_reports = text, submission_files, certification

    [transport:c3]
    secure_id = <your secure ID>

    [transport:local_file]
    type = file
    path = /home/ubuntu/c3-local-submission.tar.xz

    [exporter:example_tar]
    unit = com.canonical.plainbox::tar

    [report:file]
    transport = local_file
    exporter = tar
    forced = yes

    [environment]
    ROUTERS = multiple
    WPA_BG_SSID = foo-bar-bg-wpa
    WPA_BG_PSK = foo-bar
    WPA_N_SSID = foo-bar-n-wpa
    WPA_N_PSK = foobar
    WPA_AC_SSID = foo-bar-ac-wpa
    WPA_AC_PSK = foobar
    OPEN_BG_SSID = foo-bar-bg-open
    OPEN_N_SSID = foo-bar-n-open
    OPEN_AC_SSID = foo-bar-ac-open
    BTDEVADDR = ff:oo:oo:bb:aa:rr
    TRANSFER_SERVER = cdimage.ubuntu.com
