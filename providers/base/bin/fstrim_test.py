"""
This script checks to see if a block device supports TRIM via a call to the
fstrim utility. This requires ensuring that a Linux partition on the target
device be mounted, so this script does this, if necessary.

The script returns 0 on success and 1 on failure, with output
via Python logging about the nature of the success/failure.
