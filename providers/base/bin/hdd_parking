This script verifies that a systems HDD protection capabilities
are triggered when appropriate. There are many implementations
of HDD protection from different OEMs, each implemented in a 
different way, so this script can only support implementations
which are known to work and are testable. Currently the list
of supported implementations is:

- HDAPS (Lenovo)
