This script examines the /proc/sys/kernel/tainted file (or a user-specified
file, for debugging purposes) and parses the contents to determine if the
kernel is tainted. If so, the script reports the nature of the taint and
returns a value of 1. The script also returns a value of 1 if
# /proc/sys/kernel/tainted cannot be found or opened. If the kernel is NOT
# tainted, the script notes this fact and returns 0.
