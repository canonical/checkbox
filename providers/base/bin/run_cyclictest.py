# Uses the cyclictest binary to run cyclictest and measure process latency.
# This test needs to run for at least 24 hours in order to provide useful data.
#
# The output from the test, as well as any errors, are then dumped into a file
# so the second part can check the results.  A passing test will depend on the
# maximum latency observed and whether that is an acceptable number.  This
# value depends on the DUT's platform and CPU.  These values are provided by
# Intel as part of the Real Time Key Performance Indicator (RT KPI) document.
#
# Pass conditions:
#   * Max latency is equal to or lower than the expected value for the DUT's HW
#   * 0 overflows (caused by a process waiting too long. also called a "miss")
#
# Fail conditions:
#   * Any errors from the test.
#   * Unacceptable values for Max Latency or Overflows.
