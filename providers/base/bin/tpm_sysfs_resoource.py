"""
Collect information about all sysfs attributes related to TPM.

This program traverses all the TPM device nodes found in /sys/class/tpm/.
Each present device is subsequently inspected by reading all readable files
in /sys/class/tpm/*/device/* and presenting the data present there as
subsequent RFC822 records. There is one record per TPM chip. In order to
differentiate each chip, each record contains the field x-sysfs-device-name
that stores the full sysfs directory name of the chip.

@EPILOG@

Unreadable files (typically due to permissions) are silently skipped.
