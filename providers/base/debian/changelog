plainbox-provider-checkbox (0.21-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release 
  * debian/control: wrap-and-sort 
  * debian/rules: don't modify .pot/.po files present in the tree 
  * debian/rules: rewrite provider directories to use more friendly names 
  * debian/rules: disable strict validation
  * debian/watch: quote the last dot of the URL pattern 
  * debian/upstream/signing-key.asc: add the public key of Sylvain
    Pineau (using gpg --armor --export-options export-minimal --export
    '7ED72CD1').
  * debian/copyright: bump Canonical copyright
  * debian/control: Use the new email address for the team
    (checkbox-devel@lists.ubuntu.com). 
  * debian/control: Depend on more recent version of plainbox to get the
    packaging meta-data unit which blocks validation.
  * debian/control, debian/rules: Depend on python3-debian for plainbox
    packaging system integration. Activate plainbox packaging integration
    through "./manage.py packaging", "X-Plainbox-Provider: yes" and
    ${plainbox:Depends} and similar. This lets plainbox look at packaging
    meta-data units contained in the provider being packaged (at .txt.in, .txt
    and .pxu files) and determine appropriate dependencies. This lessens the
    maintenance burden on the package maintainer and shifts it onto the
    upstream developers to provide accurate packaging meta-data for each
    specific distribution. This also means that separate packaging for similar
    distributions (Debian, Ubuntu and bleeding-edge Ubuntu PPA is far easier
    to work with as bulk of the work is shared).
  * debian/copyright: de-duplicate licenses, as reported by lintian
  * debian/control: bump standards version to 3.9.6 (no change required)

plainbox-provider-checkbox (0.4-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release. List of bugfixes:
    https://launchpad.net/plainbox-provider-checkbox/14.04/0.4
  * debian/watch: look for new releases on launchpad
  * debian/rules: stop using pybuild and use manage.py
    {i18n,build,install,validate} instead. This also drops dependency on
    python3-distutils-extra and replaces that with intltool
  * debian/control: drop X-Python3-Version
  * debian/control: make plainbox-provider-checkbox depend on python and
    python2.7 (for some scripts) rather than suggesting them.
  * debian/upstream/signing-key.asc: Use armoured gpg keys to avoid having to
    keep binary files in Debian packaging. Also, replace that with my key
    since I made the 0.3 release upstream.
  * debian/source/lintian-overrides: add an override for warning about no
    source for flash movie with reference to a bug report that discusses that
    issue.
  * debian/source/include-binaries: drop (no longer needed)
  * debian/patches: drop (no longer needed)
  * debian/plainbox-provider-checkbox.lintian-overrides: drop (no longer
    needed)
  * Stop being a python3 module, move to from DPMT to PAPT
