 This test will verify that the volume levels are at an acceptable level on
 your local system.  The test will validate that the volume is greater than
 or equal to minvol and less than or equal to maxvol for all sources (inputs)
 and sinks (outputs) recognized by PulseAudio.  It will also validate that the
 active source and sink are not muted.  You should not manually adjust the
 volume or mute before running this test.
