_description:
 Some new hard drives include a feature that parks the drive heads after a short period of inactivity. This is a power-saving feature, but it can have a bad interaction with the operating system that results in the drive constantly parked then activated. This produces excess wear on the drive, potentially leading to early failures.

 PURPOSE:
  This test checks that a systems drive protection mechanism works properly.
 STEPS:
  1. Click on Test
  2. Move the system under test around, ensuring it is raised and lowered at some point.
 VERIFICATION:
  The verification of this test is automated. Do not change the
  automatically selected result.
