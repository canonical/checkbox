  STEPS:
    1. Prior to running this test, you should have configured and used IPMI to power this machine off and on using every Network Port available.
  VERIFICATION:
    1. Select Yes if you successfully used IPMI to remotely power this system off and on using the NIC $2
    2. Select No if you did not attempt to use IPMI to remotely power this sytem off and on via the NIC $2

_description:
 PURPOSE:
  Some systems do not share IPMI over all NICs but instead have a dedicated management port directly connected to the BMC.  This test verifies that you have used that port for remote IPMI connections and actions.
 STEPS:
  1. Prior to running the test, you should have configured and used the Dedicated Management Port to remotely power off/on this sytem.
 VERIFICATION:
  Skip this test if this system ONLY uses shared management/ethernet ports OR if this system does not have a BMC (Management Console)
  1. Select Yes if you successfully used IPMI to remotely power this system off and on using the dedicated management port.
  2. Select No if you attempted to use the dedicated management port to remotely power this system off/on and it failed for some reason.
