  PURPOSE:
      This test will check your $product device's ability to read CD media
  STEPS:
      1. Insert appropriate non-blank media into your optical drive(s). Movie and Audio Disks may not work. Self-created data disks have the greatest chance of working.
      2. If a file browser window opens, you can safely close or ignore that window.
      3. Click "Test" to begin the test.
  VERIFICATION:
      This test should automatically select "Yes" if it passes, "No" if it fails.

  PURPOSE:
      This test will check your system's $product CD writing capabilities. This test requires a blank CD-R or CD+R.
  STEPS:
      Skip this test if you do not have a blank CD disk.
      1. Insert a blank CD-R or CD+R into your drive
      2. Click "Test" to begin.
      3. When the CD tray ejects the media after burning, close it (DO NOT remove the disk, it is needed for the second portion of the test). Note, you must close the drive within 5 minutes or the test will time out.
  VERIFICATION:
      This test should automatically select "Yes" if it passes, "No" if it fails.
