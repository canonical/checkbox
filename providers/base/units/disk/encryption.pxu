_summary: Disk decryption after TPM change
_description:
_purpose:
 The device partition is encrypted using TPM master key. To unseal the master
 key from TPM, PCR7 (Platform Configuration Register 7) needs to be identical
 to the value it had when the master key was sealed into TPM. Every time the
 device boots, it checks PCR7 to unseal TPM and retrieves master key from TPM
 to decrypt its data partition. If TPM PCR7 is modified (e.g. by flashing the
 BIOS), the device won't be able to get the master key and decrypt its data
 partition. This test verifies the system's resilience against unauthorized 
 modifications by ensuring it cannot boot if the PCR7 value is altered.
_steps:
 NOTE: YOU'LL HAVE TO RE-INSTALL THE IMAGE AFTER THIS TEST.
 1. Install the image and make sure it boots and you can log in.
 2. Ensure the BIOS is set up correctly (e.g., TPM enabled, UEFI boot mode).
 3. Depending on the DUT, choose one of these methods to clean TPM:
    a. Turn the device off and upgrade/downgrade the BIOS or modify Secure Boot state.
    b. Clean TPM via BIOS menu.
    c. Install checkbox, execute "checkbox-[project name].checkbox-cli run com.canonical.certification::tpm2.0_3.0.4/tpm2_takeownership".
 4. Start or reboot the device.
_verification:
 Mark this test as "Passed" if the device cannot boot anymore.
