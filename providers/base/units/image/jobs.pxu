_summary: Check that the model grade is correctly set
requires:
 lsb.distributor_id == "Ubuntu Core" and int(lsb.release) >= 20
_purpose:
 Images with the 'dangerous' grade (the lowest of all available grades)
 results in certain security measures being relaxed.
 Images that require strict security-related implementations must
 have the model grade set to non-dangerous grades - either the highest
 grade of 'secured', or a grade passed to Checkbox for checking via the
 MODEL_GRADE configuration variable.
