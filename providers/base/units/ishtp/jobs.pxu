depends: eclite/module-detect
_description:
    For testing the feature of Eclite, one way is to monitor the
    temperature of acpitz thermal.
    Read the CPU temperature, run stress-ng for 5 minutes, then check the CPU
    temperature again.
    The temperatures should be non-zero, and the temperature after the stress
    test should be higher.
    If any of these conditions is not true, the test fails.
