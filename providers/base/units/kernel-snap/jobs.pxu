_description:
  In Ubuntu Core 16 & Ubuntu Core 18 images for devices using Full Disk
  Encryption it is necessary to inform snapd that when a kernel snap is
  refreshed the kernel image should be extracted and placed in the boot
  partition.

  On some Ubuntu Core devices it is necessary for the kernel image to be
  extracted from the kernel snap and placed in the boot partition (notably 
  device using full disk encryption). This checks the images are in sync.
