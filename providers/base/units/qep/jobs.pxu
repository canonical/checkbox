 Checks that the device exists in lspci and that the device driver associated is correct.
 Device ID should be 8086:{qep-device} and the driver is always intel_qep.

 Detects if the device's directory exists.
 First needs to find the PCI ID from lspci
 Then tests if the PCI device directory exists.
 The PCI ID is always ##:##.# (e.g. 18:00.2)
 The PCI device directory is always in the format of 0000:$PCI_ID
