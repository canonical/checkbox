estimated_duration: 24h
_summary:
    Run cyclictest to test scheduling latency. Default run time is 24 hours.
_purpose:
    This test executes the cyclictest command for a long period of time to 
    evaluate the system's ability to maintain scheduling latency. It checks
    that the maximum latency did not exceed the threshold and that there are no
    overflows (scheduling misses) for each thread.

estimated_duration: 60s
_summary:
    A short-duration cyclictest to validate the system's real-time capabilities.
_purpose:
    This test runs for 60 seconds to provide a rapid assessment of the system's
    real-time performance. It uses the cyclictest tool to measure the scheduling
    latency and overflow occurrences. The goal is to ensure that basic real-time
    functions can be executed without latency spikes.
