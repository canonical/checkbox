_description:
 PURPOSE:
     This test will check if your system can support daisy-chaining of a storage
     and a monitor over Thunderbolt port
 STEPS:
     1. Connect your Thunderbolt monitor to your systems
     2. Connect and mount your Thunderbolt HDD to another Thunderbolt port of the
        monitor (you can do this with HDD first as well)
     3. Click 'Test' to perform the storage test on the Thunderbolt HDD
 VERIFICATION:
     1. The verification for storage is automated, please select the result combine
        with the result for the display.
     2. Was the desktop displayed correctly on the Thunderbolt-connected screen?
