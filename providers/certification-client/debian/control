Description: Meta-package to selectively install glmark2-es2
 The objective of this metapackage is not introducing architecture specificity
 in checkbox-provider-certification-client. This metapackage will cause
 installation of glmark2-es2 on arm architectures, while just being a dummy
 package on others. Arch-independent packages can depend on this one to (maybe)
 install glmark2-es2.
