plainbox-provider-resource-generic (0.23-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release
  * debian/watch: match new upstream tarball names
  * debian/rules: simplify override_dh_auto_install since installation
    directories are all named plainbox-provider-resource-generic

plainbox-provider-resource-generic (0.19-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release
  * List of bug fixes and enhancements:
    https://launchpad.net/plainbox-provider-resource/trunk/0.18
    https://launchpad.net/plainbox-provider-resource/trunk/0.19
  * Allow debian/rules 'clean' to fail so that plainbox doesn't have to be
    installed to build the source package in a clean tree. 
  * debian/control: Use the new email address for the team
    (checkbox-devel@lists.ubuntu.com). 
  * debian/control: Depend on more recent version of plainbox to get the
    packaging meta-data unit which blocks validation.
  * debian/control, debian/rules: Depend on python3-debian for plainbox
    packaging system integration. Activate plainbox packaging integration
    through "./manage.py packaging", "X-Plainbox-Provider: yes" and
    ${plainbox:Depends} and similar. This lets plainbox look at packaging
    meta-data units contained in the provider being packaged (at .txt.in, .txt
    and .pxu files) and determine appropriate dependencies. This lessens the
    maintenance burden on the package maintainer and shifts it onto the
    upstream developers to provide accurate packaging meta-data for each
    specific distribution. This also means that separate packaging for similar
    distributions (Debian, Ubuntu and bleeding-edge Ubuntu PPA is far easier
    to work with as bulk of the work is shared).

plainbox-provider-resource-generic (0.17-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release 
  * debian/copyright: refresh dates 
  * debian/rules: rename provider directories to avoid having colon in any
    filesystem path 
  * debian/control: bump Standards-Version to 3.9.6 (no change required) 
  * debian/upstream/signing-key.asc: Re-export the public key of Sylvain
    Pineau (using gpg --armor --export-options export-minimal --export
    '7ED72CD1'). The old key there didn't validate and I'm not quite sure
    whose key that was. 
  * debian/watch: escape one more dot

plainbox-provider-resource-generic (0.3-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release. List of bugfixes:
    https://launchpad.net/plainbox-provider-resource/14.04/0.3
  * debian/watch: look for new releases on launchpad
  * debian/control: make plainbox-provider-resource-generic arch=any as it
    builds C source for one provider-specific executable now, also depend on
    autotools, intltool and two netlink libraries
  * debian/rules: stop using pybuild and use manage.py
    {i18n,build,install,validate} instead. The build rule also regenerates.
    autotools scripts that are present in the tarball.
  * debian/control: drop X-Python3-Version 
  * debian/patches: drop (no longer needed)
  * debian/upstream/signing-key.asc: Use armoured gpg keys to avoid having to
    keep binary files in Debian packaging. Also, replace that with my key
    since I made the 0.3 release upstream.
  * debian/source/include-binaries: no longer needed 
  * Stop being a python3 module, move to from DPMT to PAPT
