"""
Kicks off a recipe build for a branch in Launchpad which has an associated
recipe.
Meant to be used as part of a checkbox release to the Hardware Certification
public PPA and the ~checkbox-dev testing PPA.

NOTE: The Hardware Certification public PPA has no further use over the
~checkbox-dev testing PPA. It is kept for historical reasons and should be
removed at some point.
