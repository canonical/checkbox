    This object rappresents the result of a query using launchpadlib. This
    was introduced here for three reasons:
    - To track what each function returns
    - To reconstruct what the returned object is capable of
    - To track the ducky typing relation between these objects

    For this reason each subclass of this class will contain a link to the
    webapi documentation, because that is what launchpadlib actually uses.
    You can expect each row in the `Default representation (application/json)`
    table to be an attribute of the class, all Custom XX methods are functions
    of the class and some XX_link attributes also have an XX field that
    resolves to the XX object.

    Ex. build.daily_build_archive_link is the link to the daily build archive
        build.daily_build_archive is the daily build archive itself (an object
            of type archive)
